Block grid allocation and field assignment programs

check1        Checks on the local geometry arrays b.ipt,b.iup,b.idn,
              b.imb,b.ibp and b.bb.ipp,b.bb.map,b.bb.imb for the 
              known block grids. This program also checks ipt_blk().

check2        Checks on the allocation and initialization of the gauge,
              Dirac and Weyl fields on the known block grids.

check3        Check of assign_ud2ubgr() and assign_ud2udblk()

check4        Check of assign_swd2swbgr() and assign_swd2swdblk()

check5        Check of assign_s2sblk(),...,assign_sdblk2sd()
