Version 1.2: 2nd public release.

- Added AVX inline-assembly to the time-critical functions (Dirac operator,
  linear algebra, SAP preconditioner, SU(3) functions). See the README file in
  the top directory of the distribution.

- Added support for blocked MPI process ranking, as is likely to be profitable
  on parallel computers with mult-core nodes (see main/README.global). 

- Made the field import/export functions more efficient by avoiding the
  previously excessive use of MPI_Barrier().

- Added import/export functions for the state of the random number generators.
  Modified the initialization of the generators so as to be independent of the
  ranking of the MPI processes. See the notes in modules/random/ranlux.c. Added 
  a check program in devel/random.

- Continuation runs of qcd1,qcd2,ym1 and ms1 now normally reset the random
  number generators to their state at the end of the previous run. The
  programs initialize the generators in the traditional way if the option
  -norng is set (see README.qcd1, for example).

- Modified the deflated SAP+GCR solver (dfl/dfl_sap_gcr.c) by replacing the
  deflation projectors through an inaccurate projection in the preconditioner
  (as suggested by Frommer et al. [arXiv:1303:1377]; the deflation subspace
  type and subspace generation algorithm are unchanged). This leads to a
  structural simplification and, after some parameter tuning, to a slight
  performance gain. NOTE: the deflation parameter set is changed too and the
  number of status variables is reduced by 1 (see modules/flags/dfl_parms.c,
  modules/dfl/dfl_sap_gcr.c and doc/parms.pdf).

- Included a program (devel/dfl/check4.c) that allows the parameters of the
  deflated SAP+GCR solver to be tuned on a given lattice.

- Deleted the now superfluous module/dfl/dfl_projectors.c.

- Added the function fdigits() [utils/mutils.c] that allows double-precision
  floating point numbers to be printed with all significant decimal digits
  (and only these). The main programs make use of this function to ensure that
  the values of the decimal parameters are printed to the log files with as
  many significant digits as were given on the input parameter file (assuming
  not more digits were specified than can be represented by a double number).

- Replaced "if" by "else if" on line 379 of main/ms2.c. This bug stopped the
  program with an error message when the CGNE solver was used. It had no
  effect when other solvers were used.

- Changed the type of the variable "sf" to "int" in lines 257 and 440 of
  forces/force0.c. This bug had no effect in view of the automatic type
  conversions performed by the compiler.

- Corrected sign in line 174 of devel/sap/check2.c. This bug led to wrong
  check results, thus incorrectly suggesting that the SAP modules were
  incorrect.

- Corrected a mistake in devel/tcharge/check2.c and devel/tcharge/check5.c
  that gave rise to wrong results suggesting that the tested modules were
  incorrect.
