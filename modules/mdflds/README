List of functions
-----------------

mdflds_t *mdflds(void)
  Returns the pointer to a mdflds_t structure containing the force and
  momentum field. The fields are automatically allocated if needed.

void set_frc2zero(void)
  Sets all force variables, including those on the boundary, to zero.

void bnd_mom2zero(void)
  Sets the time-like components of the momentum field at time
  NPROC0*L0-1 to zero. In the case of Schroedinger functional
  boundary conditions, the momentum field on the spatial links
  at time 0 and NPROC0*L0-1 is set to zero too.

void random_mom(void)
  Sets the elements X of the momentum field to random values with
  distribution proportional to exp(tr{X^2}). The time-like components
  at time NPROC0*L0-1 are set to zero. In the case of Schroedinger 
  functional boundary conditions, the momentum field on the spatial 
  links at time 0 and NPROC0*L0-1 is set to zero too.

double momentum_action(void)
  Returns the action of the momentum field.

void copy_bnd_frc(void)
  Fetches the force variables on the boundaries of the local lattice
  from the neighbouring processes.

void add_bnd_frc(void)
  Adds the values of the force variables on the boundaries of the  
  local lattice to the force field on the neighbouring processes.

void free_fcom_bufs(void)
  Frees the communication buffers used in this module.
