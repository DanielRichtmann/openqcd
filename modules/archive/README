List of functions
-----------------

void write_cnfg(char *out)
  Writes the lattice sizes, the processor grid, the rank of the
  calling process, the state of the random number generator and the
  local double-precision gauge field to the file "out".

void read_cnfg(char *in)
  Reads the data previously written by the program write_cnfg from
  the file "in" and resets the random number generator and the local
  double-precision gauge field accordingly. The program checks that
  the configuration satisfies open boundary conditions.

void export_cnfg(char *out)
  Writes the lattice sizes and the global double-precision gauge field to
  the file "out" from process 0 in the universal format specified below.

void import_cnfg(char *in)
  Reads the global double-precision gauge field from the file "in" from
  process 0, assuming that the field is stored in the universal format.
  The field is periodically extended if needed and the program imposes 
  open boundary conditions when they are not already satisfied.

void write_mfld(char *out)
  Writes the lattice sizes, the processor grid, the rank of the
  calling process and the local part of the field to the file "out".

void read_mfld(char *in)
  Reads the local part of the momentum field from the file "in",
  assuming the field was previously stored on this file by the program
  write_mfld().

void export_mfld(char *out)
  Writes the lattice sizes and the momentum field to the file "out"
  from process 0 in the universal format specified below.

void import_mfld(char *in)
  Reads the momentum field from the file "in" and extends the field
  periodically if needed. The file is read by process 0 only and it is
  assumed that the field is stored on the file in the universal format.

void write_sfld(char *out,spinor_dble *sd)
  Writes the lattice sizes, the processor grid, the rank of the
  calling process, the size of the spinor_dble structure, the square 
  of the norm of the spinor field sd and the local part of the latter 
  to the file "out".

void read_sfld(char *in,spinor_dble *sd)
  Reads the local part of the spinor field sd from the file "in",
  assuming the field was previously stored on this file by the
  program write_sfld().

void export_sfld(char *out,spinor_dble *sd)
  Writes the lattice sizes and the spinor field sd to the file "out"
  from process 0 in the universal format specified below.

void import_sfld(char *in,spinor_dble *sd)
  Reads the spinor field sd from the file "in". The file is read by
  process 0 only and it is assumed that the field is stored on the
  file in the universal format.
